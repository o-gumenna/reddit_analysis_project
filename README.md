# reddit_analysis_project
This project explores the dynamics of public opinion on the Reddit platform during major winter fires in the Los Angeles area in January 2025. The goal of the study will be to find out how the focus of discussions changes in response to extreme situations.

The research analyzes 3.59M comments over 4 months to identify how attention shifted across topics — from fire → humanitarian aid → government →  politics → conspiracy narratives.

The project includes data preprocessing, categorization, topic modeling (TF-IDF), sentiment trends,  
and visual interpretation of behavioral crisis dynamics.
